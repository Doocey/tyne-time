Even after Marseille president claiming Ben Arfa would be staying in France with L'OM, and even after Hughton admitted he didn't know where the rumours of this supposed capture were coming from - Hatem Ben Arfa has been spotted in Newcastle Airport. Whether this is true, or just unbelievable Photoshoppin', either way there's questions still to be answered.
