### Fans - Tired of Ashley and his ownership

After an embarrassing defeat  to Leyton Orient yesterday it really put a cap on Mike Ashley's tenure. Probably the biggest friendly loss in a long time, the Newcastle players didn't seem bothered, besides the odd exception. It can't be called anything short of a disgrace and Leyton players were magnificent to say the least. Mind you, Orient are a League 1 side and we have to play many a Championship game this year, who inevitably will be better than Leyton. The most annoying thing is, there's been no communication from Derek Llambias over the progress of the sale, even if they're not obliged to speak, surely you think they'd keep the fans updated somewhat.

But no, that's not Mike Ashley's style, he prefers to keep us in the dark over pretty much everything. Hope's were high when he arrived but Newcastle have hit their lowest in about 20 years. All because of one man - Mike Ashley. Agreed Freddy Shepherd was bringing Newcastle down financially but at least he would communicate with the fans. To be honest, I'd rather have Freddy now then continue in the state we're in. My belief is, that should Shearer have been installed as manager after we were relegated and have brought in a few players, we could have had a major promotion push this season. But now, I can't see that happening, especially when the season starts in two weeks. Thanks a lot Ashley for bringing us down, in every sense.

Comments welcome.
