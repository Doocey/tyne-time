### Harewood - Enjoying his first training session

It could only happen at Newcastle, where their local cult hero, leaves the club, not for the first time, and then, turn around and tries to sue the clubs owner. As yo probably guessed it's Kevin Keegan I'm talking about and his little affair with Mike Ashley. Today, the case closed are the tribunal resigned in order to make their decision. Whether Keegan will win his case is still unknown but he must be pretty confident when he's brought the millionaire to the courts over 'an unfair dismissal'.

The club said :

> The Premier League tribunal considering Kevin Keegan's departure from the Club in September 2008 has today retired to consider its judgement.
>
> The Club will be making no further comment at this time.

So, who will win it, it will be a very interested affair to see who comes out on top and should it be Kevin Keegan, then some say, it will be a victory for football. Perhaps it might.

In other news, Marlon Harewood trained with his new teammates for the first time and expressed his delight at the move. Hopefully he score some goals and that the dream of returning to the top flight at first attempt comes a reality.

Comments welcome
