Content files, including articles in markdown for the [NUFC Blog](https://www.tynetime.com).

A converted _WordPress_ (2009) -> _Hugo_ (2017) -> **Astro** (2024) project intended to decouple the front-end and keep things minimalistic.

Built in [Astro](https://astro.build/), hosted on GitHub for data store, and served by Netlify with SSL from the fantastic Let's Encrypt. All blog posts are Markdown files, for easy future migration, portability, and to keep true ownership over content.
