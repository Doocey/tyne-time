Content files, including articles in markdown for the [NUFC Blog](https://www.tynetime.com) Tyne Time.

A converted _WordPress_ (2009) &rarr; _Hugo_ (2017) &rarr; **Astro** (2024) project intended to decouple the front-end and keep things minimalistic.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), hosted on GitHub for data store, and served by Cloudflare. All blog posts are Markdown files, for easy future migration, portability, and to keep true ownership over content.

Analytics via the excellent open-source [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to ensure <u>no tracking of personal data</u>.
